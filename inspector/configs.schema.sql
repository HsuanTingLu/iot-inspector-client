/*

    Schema for the configs database

    Saves all configurations and UI state, readable and writable by the GraphQL
    server, but only readable by the Python server.

    This database includes the following tables:

    - device_info: names of devices and whether they are inspected
    - state_kv: a key-value store for overall application state and settings

    Data types:
    - All lists are JSON encoded.
    - All boolean fields are represented as 1 for true and 0 for false.

    See the system design diagram here:
